## Live version on [aarongeraci.com](https://aarongeraci.com/)

For this site I wanted to try [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) UI. In comparison to Shadcn and MUI I would say MUI is my favorite to work with. Mantine feels like a step between MUI and Shadcn as it lets you build some of the components while having access to a library of examples to pull from like Shadcn.

I plan to continue to add to this. Mostly because this is just the beginning of my developer journey.

Some things I want to add/learn:

* [ ] Skillls section
* [ ] Education
* [ ] Rive animation
* [ ] Paralax background
* [ ] visitor count
